Gettings started with Drush (Drupal Shell)


I was configuring a drupal site but i was having slow connections since last few days... so it kinda got irritating clicking a link and waiting for a page to load .. then again click submit button.
Just remember how many times u have to click and number of pages u have to load just to enable a module.
Well it just got a lot easier with drush (drupal shell)

Here's how u can download,enable and use it:

It indeed saves awful lot of time :)

Installing Drush:
Get latest drush download link from
http://drupal.org/project/drush

ssh to ur remote site, or just go to folder of ur localsite

go to site's root folder
$ cd example.com/html

download drush:
/$ wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drush-All-versions-3.0.tar.gz


u can extract it to site's root folder
/$ tar -xzf drush-All-versions-3.0.tar.gz

Using Drush:

once installed, the only thing u need to do from now on is,
use it to download/enable/disable modules u want (btw, u shud know the correct names of the modules)
/$ drush/drush dl module_name1 module_name2 

Example:
/$ drush/drush dl recaptcha 
/$ drush/drush en recaptcha

it might show errors.. because recaptcha module depends on another module "captcha"

so now to resolve dependency download the "captcha" module, and then enable the recaptcha module
/$ drush/drush dl captcha
/$ drush/drush en recaptcha

OR if u already know the dependencies then u can just download both modules in one command and enable it:
/$ drush/drush dl captcha recaptcha
/$ drush/drush en recaptcha


To disable a module
/$ drush/drush dis recaptcha


and now to uninstall
/$ drush/drush pm-uninstall recaptcha

These are the basic and pretty simple drush commands that are often used.


For other advanced drush commands simply type:
/$ drush/drush


OR refer:
http://groups.drupal.org/drush/commands

PS: u can add 'path/to/drush' as an alias in .bashrc ... for more info on this refer to drush/README.txt file
