Wikis: Collaborative Knowledge Bases

All of us must have used Wikipedia to find answers to countless questions. Isn't it amazing that Wikipedia, a community driven collaborative encyclopedia, has amassed wealth of information on such a wide range of topics through contribution from people around the globe. Wikipedia is based on the concept of wiki. 

According to Wikipedia, "A wiki is a website  that allows the easy creation and editing of any number of interlinked web pages via a web browser using a simplified markup language or a WYSIWYG text editor. Wikis are typically powered by wiki software and are often used to create collaborative websites, to power community websites, for personal note taking, in corporate intranets, and in knowledge management systems."

However, Wikipedia is not the only collaborative wiki building the public knowledge. Several sites have adopted the wiki based model and accumulated knowledge, few of them are general purpose while others are for specific purpose. Following are some of the most famous and noteworthy wiki based sites :

* Wikipedia
    Wikipedia is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project based on an openly-editable model. The information on Wikipedia now surpasses 15 million articles in more than 270 languages and English encyclopedia alone has about 3.3 million articles. Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous Internet volunteers who write without pay. Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles. Every contribution may be reviewed or changed. The expertise or qualifications of the user are usually not considered. This is possible since Wikipedia's intent is to cover existing knowledge which is verifiable from other sources.

* OpenStreetMap
    OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The maps are created using data from portable GPS devices, aerial photography, other free sources or simply from local knowledge. Both rendered images and the vector graphics are available for download under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 licence. OpenStreeMap was inspired by sites such as Wikipedia; the map display features a prominent 'Edit' tab and a full revision history is maintained. Registered users can upload GPS track logs and edit the vector data using the given editing tools.
    OpenStreetMap (OSM) was founded in July 2004 by Steve Coast. In April 2006, a foundation was established to encourage the growth, development and distribution of free geospatial data and provide geospatial data for anybody to use and share. By August 2008, shortly after the second The State of the Map conference was held, there were over 50,000 registered contributors; by March 2009 there were 100,000 and by the end of 2009 the figure was nearly 200,000.
    OpenStreetMap has received data from some government agencies that have released official data on appropriate licenses. Much of this data has come from the United States, where the federal government does not copyright such data. Some data has also been acquired UK. Besides, some commercial companies have donated data to the project on suitable licenses. Notably, from Automotive Navigation Data (AND) who provided a complete road dataset for Netherlands and details of trunk roads in China and India. In December 2006, Yahoo! confirmed that OpenStreetMap was able to make use of their vertical aerial imagery and this photography is now available within the editing software as an overlay. Contributors can create their vector based maps as a derived work, released with a free and open license.

* LyricWiki
   LyricWiki is a lyrical database-oriented website. Users on the site can view, edit, and discuss the lyrics of songs, which are also available for purchase from links on the site. The site is powered by MediaWiki and is searchable by song, artist, album, genre, hometown, label, and language. Users are told to be mindful of copyright  while contributing, and copyright violations are removed upon request. The article count on the site exceed 1.4 million. The site allows programmatic access to the contents of its database through a webservice. This API has been leveraged to create plugins for many media players including Winamp, Amarok, Windows Media Player, iTunes, musikCube, foobar2000, and more. A Mac OS X Dashboard app has also been made, designed to pull lyric data from LyricWiki as the songs are playing, and then update the ID3 tag for the song in iTunes. As of August 2, 2009, however, lyrics themselves can no longer be supplied through the API, due to licensing issues.

* Uncyclopedia
   Uncyclopedia is a website that parodies  Wikipedia. Originally an English-language wiki, the project currently spans over 50 languages. The English version has over 25,000 pages of content.
   Various styles of humour are used as a vehicle for parody, from sophisticated satire to the apparently random. Like Wikipedia, Uncyclopedia has guidelines regarding what is and is not acceptable content and these guidelines have become progressively more strict as the site expands over time. The site has gained media attention due to its articles on places and people.
   Its logo, a hollow potato named Sophia after the Gnostic deity serves as a parody of Wikipedia's globe logo. Uncyclopedia's stated goal is to "provide the world's misinformation in the least redeeming and most searingly sarcastic and humorous way possible, through satire".

* Wikileaks
   Wikileaks is a Sweden-based organization that publishes anonymous submissions and leaks  of sensitive documents from governments and other organizations, while preserving the anonymity of their sources. Its website, launched in 2006, is run by The Sunshine Press. Within a year of its launch, the site said its database had grown to more than 1.2 million documents. It has won a number of new media awards for its reports. Citing fundraising problems, Wikileaks temporarily suspended all operations other than submission of material in December 2009. The site's archive came back online in May 2010.
   Wikileaks' stated goal is to ensure that whistle-blowers and journalists are not jailed for emailing sensitive or classified documents, as happened to Chinese journalist Shi Tao, who was sentenced to 10 years in 2005 after publicising an email from Chinese officials about the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. In May 2010 it was rated number 1 of "web sites that could totally change the news".
   Some of the most notable leaks by Wikileaks include:
	# Sarah Palin's Yahoo email account contents
	# 9/11 pager messages
	# Toxic dumping in Africa - The Minton report
          # Baghdad airstrike video

* WikiAnswers
    WikiAnswers is a website where knowledge is shared freely in the form of questions and answers (Q&A). Anyone can ask a question and anyone from anywhere in the world can answer it. This sharing of knowledge in turn becomes part of a permanent information resource. WikiAnswers leverages wiki technology and fundamentals, allowing communal ownership and editing of content. Each question has a "living" answer, which is edited and improved over time by the WikiAnswers.com community. WikiAnswers.com uses an Alternates System â€“ where every answer can have dozens of different Questions that "trigger" it. When a Contributor asks a question similar to an existing one, the system connects the question to it as an "alternate". This prevents duplicate entries in an effort to promote cohesive answers and a better user experience. As of January 2009, it had over 9,000,000 questions; over 3,000,000 answers; 4,470 categories; over 2 million contributors; and over 500 volunteer Supervisors. According to comScore September 2009 data, WikiAnswers had 46.3 million unique visitors in the US  and is the leading Q&A website on the internet.
    According to the Terms of Use, WikiAnswers do not claim ownership of contributions. The contributors are forced to grant a very liberal and permissive license to WikiAnswers, which in turn sub-licenses the contributions under much less permissive terms to the user. The user is allowed to download the content for personal use only. In particular he or she is not allowed to modify and publish the content without permission from either Answers.com or the copyright owner (the contributor).  One is allowed to cite from WikiAnswers in their own writings.

* Wikitravel
    Wikitravel is a Web-based collaborative travel guide project, based upon the wiki model, launched by Evan Prodromou and Michele Ann Jenkins in 2003. In 2006, Internet Brands bought the trademark and servers and later introduced advertising to the website. Articles on wikitravel can cover any level of geographic specificity, from continents to districts of a city. These are logically connected in a hierarchy, by specifying that the location covered in one article "is in" the larger location described by another. The project also includes articles on travel-related topics, phrasebooks for travelers, and suggested itineraries.
    Wikitravel is a multilingual project available in 21 languages, with each language-specific project developed independently. At present, Wikitravels has more than 23000 articles in English language and more than 54000 in all languages. 
    On May 1, 2007, Wikitravel received the Webby Award for Best Travel Website. On June 16, 2008, Wikitravel was named one of the "50 Best Websites of 2008" by Time Magazine.
    Wikitravel contents are available under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license; while Internet Brands owns the web site and associated trademarks, contributors own the content they contribute and they agree to license that content for free use.
