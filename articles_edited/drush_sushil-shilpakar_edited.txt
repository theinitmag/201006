* Gettings started with Drush (Drupal Shell)

Drupal configuration can get frustrating if you are installing a lot of modules, enabling and disabling them and other such mundane tasks. Add to that, flaky internet connection and lack of inspiration or maybe some caffiene. Going from Drupal installation to fully online can be a nightmare.

Enter Drush. 

"Drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal, a veritable Swiss Army knife designed to make life easier for those of us who spend some of our working hours hacking away at the command prompt."

Here's how u can download, enable and use it:

** Installing Drush

Get latest drush download link from
http://drupal.org/project/drush

ssh to ur remote site, or just go to folder of your localsite

go to site's root folder

$ cd example.com/html

Download drush:

$ wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drush-All-versions-3.0.tar.gz

You can extract it to site's root folder

$ tar -xzf drush-All-versions-3.0.tar.gz

** Using Drush

Once installed one major task that drush is used for is to download/enable/disable modules (correct name of the modules is required though)

$ drush/drush dl module_name1 module_name2 

Example:

$ drush/drush dl recaptcha 
$ drush/drush en recaptcha

Now, it might show some error. That's because recaptcha module depends on another module "captcha". So to resolve dependency download the "captcha" module, and then enable the recaptcha module

$ drush/drush dl captcha
$ drush/drush en recaptcha

Alternatively, if u already know the dependencies then you can just download both modules in one command and enable it:

$ drush/drush dl captcha recaptcha
$ drush/drush en recaptcha

*** To disable a module

$ drush/drush dis recaptcha

and now to uninstall

$ drush/drush pm-uninstall recaptcha

These are the basic and pretty simple drush commands that are often used.

For other advanced drush commands simply type:

$ drush/drush
