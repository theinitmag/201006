We feel very proud to bring to you yet another issue of 'The init Magazine'. We are really overwhelmed by the response to the revival of the magazine. We had wonderful feedback for our last issue and we hope to cater good content in our coming issues as well.

This issue is packed with several interesting articles. A new version of Fedora was released a few weeks ago. We bring you a brief review of the same. You will find interesting articles on Map Reduce technology, monetary aspect of Open Source along with others and as usual a useful HowTo section.

We sincerely hope that you will like the issue. The magazine is a community effort and any interest in contribution (editing, layout, etc) is warmly welcome. Please send in your articles and feedback at theinitmag@gmail.com and help us spread the words.

Cheers,
The init Magazine Editorial Team
